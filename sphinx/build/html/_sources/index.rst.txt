What is wrappy(o6)?
----------------------
Wrappy(o6) is a python binding for `open62541 <http://open62541.org>`_.
While wrappy(o6) tries to be truthful to it's roots in terms of handling it still aims at offering some quality of life
improvements and getting rid of certain c typical conventions which feel weird in python.
If you are already familiar with open62541 and know some basic python you'll hopefully feel right at home in wrappy(o6)
we hope you'll feel right at home in Wrappy(o6) and can make use of the vast range of available python libraries while
still being able to use the well established open62541 as a backend.

.. Warning::
    Please be aware that wrappy(o6) is still in an early development phase.
    Please refer to :ref:`Open issues<Open issues>` for more information regarding open62541 features which are not
    available yet as well as general limitations and issues.

Getting started
=================

Dependencies
---------------------------------
*  python 3.6 or newer (tested with 3.6, 3.7, 3.8)
*  pip
*  cffi (installable via pip)

Installation

Custom Data Types
---------------------

Wrappy(o6) lacks sufficient support of custom data types. To a limited extend it is already possible to create custom
data types since all necessary c types (namely ``UA_DataType``, ``UA_DataTypeArray``,
``UA_ClientConfig.customDataTypes``, ``UA_DataTypeMember``, ``UA_DataType``) are available in wrappy(o6).
Nevertheless an intuitive an efficient handling has yet to be accomplished.

To achieve a satisfactory usability there are several issues to face, mostly regarding the typing in Python.
In the following, the problems should be outlined and possible approaches to their solution should be discussed.

In open62541 custom data types are representations of (structured) types such as structs, enums and unions. Mapping
those types onto ``UA_DataTypeMembers`` and ``UA_DataTypes`` is quite straight forward.
In python there is much more work to do.
Since python is highly dynamically typed it is harder to determine the structure of an object (and hence the offsets and
paddings of its fields) by its class definition.
Even with the typing library, most of the type hints do not apply at runtime (they mostly are really just *hints*).
As a consequence there is no equivalent to the c function
``offsetof()``. If the user should not be left with calculating the paddings all by themselves, a similar method – 
meaning a method which takes a class and returns the offsets or rather paddings of the fields (instance variables) – 
must be implemented in Python.
We want to make a rough suggestion how this could be done (at least for custom data types based on namespace zero) and
how to proceed to obtain the ``UaDataType``.

For sake of the following explanations let uns suppose we want to build a custom data type corresponding to a struct
like this.

.. code-block:: c

    typedef struct {
        UA_Xxx field1;
        UA_Yyy field2;
        ...
    } SomeType;

How could this be translated to Python? One strategy could be using *NamedTuples*.


**Calculate the paddings**

The class `typing.NamedTuple <https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html>`_ provides struct-like easy to write
objects with type hints.

.. code-block:: python

    class SomeType(NamedTuple):
        field1: UaXxx
        field2: UaYyy
        ...

It has to be examined whether and to which extend the type hints can be accessed via inflection at runtime.

What we want for the calculation of the offset and the further procedure, are the entries in ``UA_TYPES`` related to the
UaType classes of the NamedTuple's fields.
Since every UaType class related to an entry in ``UA_TYPES`` knows that entry it would suffice to just get the UaType
classes which are type hinted.
In terms of our example this is ``UaXxx._UA_TYPE`` (which would be a c macro like ``UA_TYPES_XXX``), ``UaYyy._UA_TYPE``
and so on.

If it is not possible to get these information via inflecting the type hints, there is another way to get the necessary
information: The user has to provide default values for all fields.

.. code-block:: python

    class SomeType(NamedTuple):
        field1: UaXxx = UaXxx()
        field2: UaYyy = UaYyy()
        ...

Then ``SomeType`` can be passed to our method ``get_offset(...)``. The method ``get_offset(...)`` could invoke
``SomeType()`` which returns a NamedTuple – we call this instance ``some_type`` – with all the default values.
The fields of ``some_type`` could now be inflected with ``type(some_type.fieldX)``. We get the UaType classes and
by this the ``UA_TYPES``.
Now we just need a mapping from the entries of ``UA_TYPES`` to the corresponding sizes.
With this we could compute the paddings for all fields of our NamedTuple ``SomeType`` and return them as a dict of pairs
``fieldX: <padding in bytes>``.


With this information a user would be able to construct the ``UaDataTypeMembers`` and ``UaDataTypes`` similar to
open62541. But still this would not feel like Python.
We rather want a static method – let us call it ``from_data_type_model(...)`` – in ``UaDataType`` which takes a class
(f.e. a NamedTuple) and returns an instance of ``UaDataType``.

**Construct the UaDataTypeMembers**

Our method ``from_data_type_model(...)`` at first has to construct the UaDataTypeMembers. Therefore the following fields
need to be determined.

*  *padding*: Already discussed above
*  *member_type_index*: Extracted for calculation of the padding as described above
*  *namespace_zero*: ``UaBoolean(True)`` since the proposed procedure can only be applied on types from namespace zero
   (a transfer should be possible)
*  *is_array*: The user has to use ``UaList`` in the NamedTuple to indicate that the field is an array. Since
   ``UaList`` knows its base type class *member_type_index* and *padding* (size of a pointer) can still be inferred
*  *is_optional*: Somehow this has to be encoded in the NamedTuple

    *  One option is to write some kind of UaDataType interface – let's call this class *UaDataTypeModel* – such that
       every class representing a custom data type has to implement *UaDataTypeModel*. One could also think of
       implementing annotations for optional fields.

*  *member_name*: Can be inflected from the NamedTuple

**Construct the UaDataType**

In a second step our method ``from_data_type_model(...)`` has to build a ``UaDataType`` from those
``UaDataTypeMembers``. Therefore we need the following fields:

*   *type_id*: Could be an argument passed to the method and determined by the user (might also be Null and
    requested from the server)
*   *binary_encoding_id*: As well determined by the user (could be passed as a separate argument or encoded via our
    interface  *UaDataTypeModel* from above)
*   *mem_size*: Can be calculated together with the paddings
*   *type_index*: Either determined by the user or as the next free index of global list of custom data types
*   *type_kind*: This again could be encoded in our in our interface *UaDataTypeModel*

    *   Note that the described procedure using NamedTuples applies to structures and structures with optional fields.
        With some adjustments it could be used for unions as well. It might also be used to represent enums. Nonetheless,
        this would be counterintuitive since one would expect static fields instead of the instance variables provided by
        NamedTuple.

*   *member_size*: Length of the ``UaList`` with the ``UaDataTypeMembers``
*   *type_name*: Can be inflected from the NamedTuple

*Good Luck! :)*

Memory Management
---------------------

To make life easier for developers, CFFI automatically does a lot of memory management for them. For the most part,
you e.g. don't have to worry to much about freeing memory yourself:
If the python garbage collector collects an object, CFFI will automatically free the memory of any referenced c
value/struct if the owner of the reference is no longer around.
Nice, right? For the most part...yes! Still, you have to keep in mind some things in regards to the concept of
ownership or else you might create segmentation faults!

Take a look at this early version of one of the asynchronous client service calls we had implemented. In this example,
the `callback` argument is being transformed into a ``void*`` ``_handle``
which is then passed to the open62541 ``UA_Client_readDataTypeAttribute_async``. Once the server has processed the
request, the client will trigger the `callback`. There is a problem though:
`_handle` is the owner of the heap memory which CFFI allocated to store our function pointer for the callback.
Because ``_handle`` is a local variable, it lives in a stack frame and also dies with the stack frame.
Yes, the reference to our handle has been passed to open62541, but CFFI doesn't really care about that. After the
function ``read_data_type_attribute_async`` stack frame was deallocated there is no longer a owner of the reference
of `_handle` in Python. The Python garbage collector will kick in and as there is no longer an owner for the callback
handle, CFFI will free the memory on the heap.

.. code-block:: python

    def read_data_type_attribute_async(self, node_id: UaNodeId,
                                       callback: Callable[['UaClient', UaUInt32, UaNodeId], None]):
        req_id = UaUInt32()
        _handle = ffi.new_handle(callback)
        status_code = lib.UA_Client_readDataTypeAttribute_async(self.ua_client,
                                                                node_id._val,
                                                                lib.python_wrapper_UA_ClientAsyncReadDataTypeAttributeCallback,
                                                                _handle,
                                                                req_id._ptr)
        return ClientServiceResult.AsyncResponse(UaStatusCode(val=status_code), req_id)

When the wrapper function ``lib.python_wrapper_UA_ClientAsyncBrowseCallback`` will call our callback, it will encounter
a segmentation fault.

.. code-block:: python

 @staticmethod
    @ffi.def_extern()
    def python_wrapper_UA_ClientAsyncBrowseCallback(client, fun, request_id, wr):
        ffi.from_handle(fun)(UaClient(val=client), UaUInt32(val=request_id, is_pointer=False),
                             UaBrowseResponse(val=wr, is_pointer=True))

So how can we address this? By making sure there is still an owner of the memory alive by the time
``python_wrapper_UA_ClientAsyncBrowseCallback`` is called!
There are different ways how this can be achieved. The following example illustrates two of them. On one hand this time
we return ``_handle`` in the result of the functon.
As long as the wrappy(o6) user stores it in a variable and keeps it alive, the callback can be called without any
issues. But this is not very intuitive and probably would cause some frustration with users.
Therefore we decided to also store a reference to the memory which is owned by ``_handle`` in a global list
(``_ClientCallback._callbacks``) which acts as a kind of shelter for all references that might have lost their home.
Now, even if the wrappy(o6) user is heartless and abandons the poor result, the owner of the callback handle
still has a place to live and we are safe from segfaults.

.. code-block:: python

 def read_data_type_attribute_async(self, node_id: UaNodeId,
                                       callback: Callable[['UaClient', UaUInt32, UaNodeId], None]):
        req_id = UaUInt32()
        _handle = ffi.new_handle(callback)
        _ClientCallback._callbacks.add(_handle)
        status_code = lib.UA_Client_readDataTypeAttribute_async(self.ua_client,
                                                                node_id._val,
                                                                lib.python_wrapper_UA_ClientAsyncReadDataTypeAttributeCallback,
                                                                _handle,
                                                                req_id._ptr)
        return ClientServiceResult.AsyncResponse(UaStatusCode(val=status_code), req_id, _handle)

So when working with CFFI always ask yourself this one question: Is it guaranteed that the owner of the memory is still
alive by the time it is dereferenced?
If not, be so kind and built some shelters. Once the references are no longer needed developers should also think about
throwing them out of the shelter to make room for new owners, life is rough as a reference and there is only so much
memory!
Let the garbage collector lead them to the afterlife.

Open issues
------------

Currently there are still a lot of open issues which need to be addressed in order to ensure a satisfying usability and
stability of wrappy(o6):

*   Tests are still very lacking. There are currently only tests for the UaClient and they are not semantically sound.
    So there is definitely a need for tests for the UaClient, UaServer and UaTypes.
*   The current handling of callbacks / function pointers has some major issues / restrictions. A reimplementation or
    adaptions to improve usability should be considered. Please refer to the :ref:`Callbacks<Callbacks>` for additional
    information.
*   Custom data types are not yet supported. Please find a draft / outline of a possible implementation strategy in the
    chapter :ref:`Custom Data Types<Custom Data Types>`.
*   Historizing is not supported yet
*   Pub/sub is not supported yet
*   The Build script has not been tested under systems other than Ubuntu 18.04/20.04
*   When building the amalgamated files of open62541 it is impossible to specify the desired version of open62541.
    Unfortunately wrappy(o6) requires all used function signatures and types to be stable (There is no way
    around that). We guarantee this by providing the whole open62541 project in version open62541-1.2 with our
    repository. So the amalgamated files will be build in the context of this old version of the project and will hence
    match the definitions used for cffi.
    Besides updating wrappy(o6) together with each new open62541 release, we do not see a convenient solution for this
    problem. Maybe following developers do.
*   The documentation needs to be improved to smoothen the experience for new users (e.g. a user guide leading through
    the provided examples as well as additional example)
*   ``UaServer`` (as well as ``UaClient``) are not available as UaTypes with accessible fields (e.g. due to opaque type
    definitions in open62541).
*   ``UaClientConfig`` and ``UaServerConfig`` are still missing some fields for lower level configurations

    *   There are functions available in open62541 (open62541/plugins/include/open62541/server_config_default.h) for
        building a UA_ServerConfig from a basic default config. They easily could be wrapped as methods of
        ``UaServerConfig`` and as such provide an comfortable way to further customize the server's configurations.

*   The behavior of double pointers (e.g. ``UA_Variant**``) as UaLists of pointers is not yet tested extensively.
    ``UaList`` could be improved for a more intuitive and coherent handling. See example_list_cast for an introduction
    on UaList.
*   As mentioned above in :ref:`Memory Management<Memory Management>` the whole issue is a bit tricky. The user still
    has to use some workarounds (see e.g. example_list_cast.py). A more stable solution should be found.
    One option might be to internally maintain a global list which holds references to the UaType objects currently
    in use to keep their memory alive. Similar to garbage collection many edge cases as well as performance issues
    have to be considered if doing so.
*   Type handling could further be improved

    *   by expanding "type guessing"
    *   by refining the methods typehints and documentation
    *   allow Python values as well as UaTypes for primitive input types where possible (already done in a few rather
        arbitrary cases)
    *   filling variables of UaTypes could be improved, e.g. via additional __init__ parameters / pseudo constructor
        methods / builder pattern
    *   implicitly applying functions which are explicit in open62541 (see e.g. ``setScalar`` and ``setArray`` handling
        in UaVariant data setter)
    *   struct fields in UA_Types which are supposed to hold arrays should in the wrapping UaType be implemented with
        UaList type instead of the array's base type. (This should be no problem since ``_value`` of a UaList is the
        same c type as the lists base type.)
    *   by providing a generic deep copy method for UaTypes
